Basic Calculator
This is a simple Python calculator program that asks the user for two numbers and a mathematical operation, then displays the result.

How It Works
The program asks the user to input the first number.
The user chooses a mathematical operation: +, -, *, or /.
The program asks for the second number.
Based on the chosen operation, the calculator performs the calculation and prints the result.
If the user enters an invalid operation, the program will display "Wrong sign!".

Example
First number: 8 Choose +, -, * or / : * Second number: 5

Output: 40.0
